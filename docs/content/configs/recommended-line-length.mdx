Configuration for the `@omnicajs/eslint-plugin-dependencies` plugin, which provides all plugin rules with preset options: sorting by string length in descending order.

This configuration will make your code prettier and more visually pleasing.

## When to Use

Use the `recommended-line-length` configuration when you want your code to look neat and visually pleasing.

This configuration is especially useful for projects where the aesthetic appearance of the code is important and where developers appreciate clean alignment and visual harmony. It helps create code that is easier to read and perceive by minimizing visual clutter and enhancing the overall structure of the code.

    {
      source: dedent`
        // eslint.config.js

        export default [
