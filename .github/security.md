# Security

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at
<https://github.com/omnicajs/eslint-plugin-dependencies/security>.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always
using the latest version of ESLint Plugin Dependencies to ensure your
application remains as secure as possible.
